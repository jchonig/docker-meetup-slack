# docker-meetup-slack
A container to post reminders about Meetup events in slack channels.

# TODO

## Configuation

* Rewrite configuration
  * Use kwalify to validate?
  * Return data as a structure?

## GraphQL enhancements

Meetup GraphQL has options for the following.  Are they not implement
yet, or do they only work if you are logged in as a user?

* uiActions
* calendarExportUrls

## Rewrite as a bot

What would this gain?

* Ability to ask bot about upcoming meetings
